<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a minimal band.link-like smart link web service for musicians (MVP).

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Roles:** Guest (fan), User (artist), Admin.
- **Core Features (MVP):**
    1.  **Auth:** User registration (email/password), login/logout.
    2.  **User Dashboard:** List smart pages, create new pages, view basic stats (views, clicks).
    3.  **Smart Link Page (Public):** Public URL  containing artist name, release title, cover image, blurred background, and a list of platform links (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, etc.).
    4.  **Page Builder (User):** Create/edit pages with fields for title, slug, artist info, cover image, and link management.
    5.  **Analytics:** Track page views and clicks per platform.
- **Subsequent Feature Requests (Implemented):**
    - Added Yandex Music and VK Music platforms.
    - Changed public URLs from  to .
    - Added a View Public Page button in the page builder.
    - Implemented link reordering (up/down buttons) with order saved to the database.
    - Added dynamic Open Graph (OG) meta tags to public pages.
    - Implemented a Scan Source feature to auto-populate links and cover art from Spotify and Apple Music URLs.
    - Added a QR code generator with an enable/disable toggle in the page builder, with the state saved and reflected on the public page.
    - Updated branding from BandLink to MyTrack.
    - Performed several UI/UX and responsiveness fixes for mobile devices.
- **Current Request:**
    - Translate all UI text strings into Russian.

**User's preferred language**: The user communicates in English, but the current task is to translate the application's UI into Russian. The next agent must continue this translation task.

**what currently exists?**
A fully functional MVP of a smart link service named MyTrack. The application includes a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, and a MongoDB database. Key features implemented are user authentication (JWT), a dashboard for artists to create and manage their link pages, public-facing pages with platform links, and a basic admin panel. Recent additions include link reordering, dynamic OG meta tags, a QR code generator, and a Scan Source feature that auto-populates platform links and cover art from Spotify/Apple Music URLs. The UI has been refined for mobile responsiveness.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent began translating the application's UI into Russian, as requested by the user. It started by viewing and applying translation edits to  and was about to proceed with .
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool. After translating each page, the agent should take a screenshot to visually verify that all English text has been replaced with Russian and that the layout remains intact.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1 (P0):**
  - **Description:** Some UI components might still have hardcoded English text that was missed during the initial translation pass.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED
  - **Next debug checklist:** After completing the primary translation task, perform a full visual scan of the application (Landing, Login, Register, Dashboard, Page Builder, Public Page) to find and translate any remaining English text.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To ensure a complete and professional user experience for Russian-speaking users.
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1 (P0): Complete the Russian Translation of the UI**
  - **Description:** Translate all English text strings in the frontend application to Russian.
  - **Where to resume:** The agent has already started with . The next file to translate is . The agent must then proceed to translate all other components and pages.
  - **What will be achieved with this?** The application will be fully localized for Russian-speaking users.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
  - **Blocked on something:** No

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- No upcoming or future tasks have been requested by the user.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full MVP Build:** Created the initial full-stack application.
- **Platform Link Expansion:** Added Yandex Music and VK Music.
- **URL Structure Change:** Migrated public pages from  to .
- **Link Reordering:** Implemented functionality to reorder platform links, with the order saved to the database.
- **SEO/Sharing Enhancement:** Added dynamic Open Graph (OG) meta tags to public pages.
- **Brand Update:** Renamed the application from BandLink to MyTrack.
- **Scan Source Feature:** Created a tool to auto-populate links and cover art from Spotify and Apple Music URLs.
- **QR Code Feature:** Added a QR code generator with persistence to the page builder and public pages.
- **Responsive UI Fixes:** Improved layout and responsiveness across the application, especially for mobile devices.
- **Mobile Overflow Fix:** Corrected layout issues on the Dashboard for narrow mobile screens.
- **Apple Music Cover Art Fix:** Implemented a backend proxy to resolve CORS issues when fetching cover art from the iTunes API.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB (via ), Pydantic models, JWT for authentication.
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components,  for animations, .
- **Architecture:** Single-server backend () providing a REST API to a React Single-Page Application (SPA).
- **APIs:** Implemented a server-side proxy to fetch data from the iTunes API to bypass browser CORS restrictions. Uses Spotify's oEmbed API.

**key DB schema**
- **users:** 
- **pages:** 
- **links:** 
- **clicks:** 

**changes in tech stack**
- None. The stack has remained FastAPI, React, and MongoDB.

**All files of reference**
- : Contains the entire backend logic, including API routes, database models, and business logic.
- : This directory contains all the main page components of the React application. All of these files will need to be edited for the translation task.
    - , , , , , , 
- : Defines the application's routes.
- : Updated to include a custom  breakpoint for better responsiveness on very narrow screens.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The entire backend is in a single  file. For future scalability, this could be broken down into multiple files (e.g., routes, models, services).

**key api endpoints**
- : User authentication.
- : CRUD operations for user pages.
- : CRUD operations for links on a page.
- : Reorders links for a page.
- : Public route to view a smart link page (handled by frontend router, data fetched from ).
- : Tracks a link click and redirects.
- : Backend proxy to fetch metadata from Apple's iTunes API.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Russian Translation:** The immediate task is to translate all frontend components into Russian. Proceed file by file through the  directory.
- **iTunes API Proxy:** The Scan Source feature for Apple Music relies on a backend proxy endpoint () to avoid browser CORS issues. The frontend calls this endpoint, not the iTunes API directly.
- **Responsive Breakpoint:** A custom  breakpoint was added to  to handle UI on very narrow screens like the iPhone SE.

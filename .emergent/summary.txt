<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially asked the agent to explore the project. After the initial exploration, the user provided a series of incremental feature requests and bug fixes:
1.  Make the sidebar menu responsive for tablets and mobile devices.
2.  Implement a fully responsive design across all pages of the application.
3.  Fix a layout issue on mobile where long URLs from the autocomplete search overflow the screen.
4.  Rework the Page Builder UI/UX:
    *   Hide the full URL in the links list, showing only the platform name.
    *   Remove the Page Title input field and auto-generate the title from the artist and song name.
    *   Move the autocomplete section to the top of the form.
    *   Re-order the remaining fields.
5.  If the user saves a page without providing a custom URL slug, automatically generate a random 5-character slug.
6.  Fix a runtime error  that occurs when navigating to the Admin Panel.
7.  Add a new FAQ page with accordion-style questions and answers, and add a link to it in the sidebar.
8.  Refactor the frontend authentication logic to persist the session using  to prevent logging out on page refresh.
9.  On the landing page, change the Login button to a Panel button if the user is already authenticated.
10. Add a Site mode feature: a switch in the user's dashboard that, when enabled, adds navigation arrows on their public pages to scroll between their different releases.
11. Refine the Site mode navigation to be an infinite loop, remove the page indicator dots, and add a back button.
12. Fix new bugs: an extra back arrow appeared, the infinite scroll isn't working, and the delete page button is broken.

**User's preferred language**: русский (Russian)

**what currently exists?**
The application is a smart link service for musicians. The agent has successfully implemented several features, including a responsive design, a mobile-friendly sidebar, a new FAQ page, and persistent authentication using localStorage. A Site mode feature has been added, which is intended to allow visitors to navigate between a musician's different public pages using arrows. However, the latest implementation of this feature introduced several bugs.

**Last working item**:
The agent was actively working on fixing three bugs reported by the user regarding the Site mode navigation and a broken delete button.

- Last item agent was working: The user reported that an extra back arrow appeared on the public page, the new infinite scroll feature wasn't working, and the delete page button was broken. The agent started by attempting to remove the extra back arrow from .
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Agent Testing Done: N
- Which testing method agent to use? Frontend testing agent
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- Issue 1: Fix bugs on Public Page navigation and Dashboard page deletion. (P0)
- Issue 2: Investigate a potential intermittent backend error related to Music. (P1)

Issues Detail:
- Issue 1:
    - **Description**: The user reported three critical bugs after the last update:
        1. An extra, unwanted back arrow is displayed in the top-left corner of the public page.
        2. The infinite scroll (cyclic navigation) between a user's public pages is not functional.
        3. The button to delete a page from the dashboard is no longer working.
    - **Attempted fixes**: The agent identified the JSX code for the unwanted back arrow in  and ran a command to remove it. The work was interrupted before the fix was completed and verified.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  **Extra Arrow**: In , ensure the  function and any remaining JSX for the back button are completely removed. The agent only removed the JSX element, not the associated function.
        2.  **Infinite Scroll**: In , review the  and  functions. The logic needs to correctly calculate the next and previous page index in a loop. The current implementation is likely flawed. Use the modulo operator for a correct cyclic calculation:  for next, and  for previous.
        3.  **Delete Button**: In , investigate the  function. Check the browser's developer console for errors when the delete button is clicked. The issue might be related to recent changes made when adding the Site mode switch. Verify the  handler is correctly wired and the API call to  is being sent.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is a high-priority bug fix request from the user. Fixing it will restore core page management functionality and correct the user-facing navigation experience.
    - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    - **Is recurring issue?**: N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    - **Blocked on other issue**: None

- Issue 2:
    - **Description**: User reported For some reason, there is sometimes an error in the backend with Music. An earlier frontend crash () was fixed, but the user's message implied a separate backend issue.
    - **Attempted fixes**: The agent fixed the frontend crash by importing the  icon in . A check of the backend code showed Music was only used as a string value (e.g., appleMusic), not an object, so the source of a backend error is unclear.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Proactively inspect the backend logs for any  or similar exceptions related to a Music variable. Use ==> /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log <==

**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, , , . State management is done via React Context ().
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (using the  async driver), JWT for authentication.
- **Authentication**: A JWT token and user object are stored in  to persist the user session across page loads. An  interceptor automatically attaches the auth header and handles 401 responses for logout.

**key DB schema**
- **users**:

**changes in tech stack**
- No changes to the core tech stack.

**All files of reference**
*Created*
- : A centralized, responsive sidebar component.
- : A new page to display frequently asked questions.

*Significantly Updated*
- : Major UI/UX overhaul for field order, auto-generation of titles, and link display.
- : Added complex logic for Site mode navigation (arrows, infinite scroll).
- : Rewrote authentication logic to use  for session persistence.
- : Integrated the new Sidebar and added the Site mode toggle switch.
- : Added a new endpoint to manage  and updated auth endpoints.
- All other pages inside  were updated to use the new  component.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The testing strategy is inefficient. The agent frequently encounters session timeouts because each  call starts a new browser context. Future tests should combine login and subsequent actions into a single script to maintain the session.

**key api endpoints**
- 
- 
- 
- : **(Likely related to the broken delete button)**
- : Fetches data for a public page.
- : Updates the user's preference for the Site mode feature.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- You must respond to the user in **Russian**.
- The immediate priority is to fix the three bugs reported by the user: the extra back arrow, the non-functional infinite scroll, and the broken delete button.
- The user is detail-oriented about UI/UX. Pay close attention to their visual feedback and requests.
- When testing, combine multiple steps (e.g., login, navigate, click) into a single  command to avoid session expiration issues that have plagued the previous agent.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-  was created and updated throughout the session.

**What agent forgot to execute**
